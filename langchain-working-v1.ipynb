You must be connected to UCSD VPN in order to browse. This is for BROWSING ONLY. You CANNOT DOWNLOAD any files. You must visit the Lab to access files until we are able to publish the data into an online portal (currently in development)\\nThe data is organized geographically, roughly by continent, with topical data arrangement inside each folder.\\nRemember, if you are looking for data on a smaller area of geography, be sure to check the folder with the larger geography first.\\xa0 An example would be if you are looking for data for only one of the states in the United States, you would want to look in the United States Data folder as well as the North America data folder.\\nVPN (Cisco AnyConnect Client)Download VPN software on your computer to get off-campus access for everything you'd get using the proxy. If you're having problems with proxy, VPN is a good alternative.

These State entities cover many topics including Water, Health, Energy, Environment, Transportation, Land Use, Boundaries, Geology, Wildlife, Education, Economy and Fire.CIESIN & SEDAC & WDC (from Columbia University)A very rich website with lots of GIS data from Columbia University portals such as CIESIN (Center for International Earth Science Information Network), SEDAC (Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center), and the World Data Center for Human Interactions.Data is PluralData is Plural is a weekly newsletter of useful/curious datasets, published by Jeremy Singer-Vine. You can browse the full data listings in a Google Spreadsheet of random datasets. A great find!DIVA GIS - DataA comprehensive and great starting point for files on administrative boundaries, water, roads, railroads, elevation, landcover, population, climate and a gazetteer for almost every country in the world.EarthWorks - Stanford UniversityDiscover and download GIS data and maps from various universities. Set the Access to Public to ensure you can download the data or maps.GeoNetwork - The portal to spatial data and informationA product of the UN FAO, this site is a great place to look for data on political boundaries, agriculture, climate, fisheries, forestry, water, land cover/use, population data, soil info and topo info.Marine/Coastal GIS ResourceFrom OSU's Davey Jones' Locker, this is a great place to start any marine/coastal GIS project. Here you will find the full spectrum of links for agencies, bibliographies, conferences, data, labs, software tools and more.NASA EarthdataEarthdata from NASA holds more than 35,000 Earth science data set and service descriptions, which cover subject areas within the Earth and environmental sciences. NASA's former Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) was rolled up into this. You can switch between various Distributed Active Archive Center (DAACs). Data and information are filtered by nine key topics: Atmosphere, Biosphere, Cryosphere, Human Dimensions, Land Surface, Ocean, Solid Earth, Sun-Earth Interactions, and Terrestrial Hydrosphere. Explore the datasets within your topic of interest.SanGISOne of the best sites to get GIS data for San Diego. Almost 100 free GIS data layers available for public download. Majority of these, including historical dates, are available through the Geisel Library Data & GIS Lab with improved metadata.SimplyAnalytics SimplyAnalytics is a web-based mapping application that lets users quickly create professional-quality thematic maps and reports using demographic, business, and marketing data for the United States. Access limited to 5 simultaneous users. Try again later if refused. Includes EASI/MediaMark Research Incorporated (MRI) and Simmons LOCAL data packages.
